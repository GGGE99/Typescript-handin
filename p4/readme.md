## Period-4 Geo-location on the backend (GeoJson, MongoDB and and geoqueries)
 


Note: This description is too big for a single exam-question. It will be divided up into separate questions for the exam
### MongoDB indexes and Geo-features
#### Explain about indexes in MongoDB, how to create them, and demonstrate how you have used them.
#### Explain, using your own code examples, how you have used some of MongoDB's "special" indexes like TTL and 2dsphere and perhaps also the Unique Index.
### Geo-location and Geojson 
#### Explain and demonstrate basic Geo-JSON, involving as a minimum, Points and Polygons
#### Explain and demonstrate ways to create Geo-JSON test data
#### Explain the typical order of longitude and latitude used by Server-Side APIs and Client-Side APIs
#### Explain and demonstrate a GraphQL API that implements geo-features, using a relevant geo-library and plain JavaScript
 #### Explain and demonstrate a GraphQL API that implements geo-features, using Mongodbâ€™s geospatial queries and indexes.
#### Explain and demonstrate how you have tested the geo-related features in you start code
