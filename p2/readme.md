Explain Pros & Cons in using Node.js + Express to implement your Backend compared to a strategy using, for example, Java/JAX-RS/Tomcat
Explain the difference between Debug outputs and ApplicationLogging. What’s wrong with console.log(..) statements in our backend code?
Demonstrate a system using application logging and environment controlled debug statements.
Explain, using relevant examples, concepts related to testing a REST-API using Node/JavaScript/Typescript + relevant packages 
Explain a setup for Express/Node/Test/Mongo-DB/GraphQL development with Typescript, and how it handles "secret values",  debug, debug-outputs, application logging and testing.
Explain a setup for Express/Node/Test/Mongo-DB/GraphQL development with Typescript. Focus on how it uses Mongo-DB (how secret values are handled, how connections (production or test) are passed on to relevant places in code, and if use, how authentication and authorization is handled

Explain, preferably using an example, how you have deployed your node/Express applications, and which of the Express Production best practices you have followed.
Explain possible steps to deploy many node/Express servers on the same droplet, how to deploy the code and how to ensure servers will continue to operate, even after a droplet restart.
Explain, your chosen strategy to deploy a Node/Express application including how to solve the following deployment problems:
Ensure that you Node-process restarts after a (potential) exception that closed the application
Ensure that you Node-process restarts after a server (Ubuntu) restart
Ensure that you can run “many” node-applications on a single droplet on the same port (80)

Explain, using relevant examples, the Express concept; middleware.
Explain, conceptually and preferably also with some code, how middleware can be used to handle problems like logging, authentication, cors and more.
Explain, using relevant examples, your strategy for implementing a REST-API with Node/Express  + TypeScript and demonstrate how you have tested the API.
Explain, using relevant examples, how to test JavaScript/Typescript Backend Code, relevant packages (Mocha, Chai etc.) and how to test asynchronous code.
NoSQL and MongoDB 
Explain, generally, what is meant by a NoSQL database.
Explain Pros & Cons in using a NoSQL database like MongoDB as your data store, compared to a traditional Relational SQL Database like MySQL.
 Explain about indexes in MongoDB, how to create them, and demonstrate how you have used them.
Explain, using your own code examples, how you have used some of MongoDB's "special" indexes like TTL and 2dsphere and perhaps also the Unique Index.
Demonstrate, using your own code samples, how to perform all CRUD operations on a MongoDB

Demonstrate how you have set up sample data for your application testing
Explain the purpose of mocha, chai, supertest and nock, which you should have used for your testing
Explain, using a sufficient example, how to mock and test endpoints that relies on data fetched from external endpoints
Explain, using a sufficient example a strategy for how to test a REST API. If your system includes authentication and roles explain how you test this part.  
Explain, using a relevant example, a full JavaScript backend including relevant test cases to test the REST-API (not on the production database)
